## 🔍 React Hooks Usage
This application utilizes React hooks to manage state and side effects, which is a key feature of functional components in React:
- **`useState`**: Used to create state variables for tracking the auto-incrementing counter and the button click count.
- **`useEffect`**: Used to set up an interval that increments the counter every second when the component mounts, and to clean up the interval when the component unmounts. 

These hooks enable a more efficient and readable way to handle component logic compared to class-based components.
